      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at the Brown University Department of Sociology. My current research draws on computational methods to build out a historical environmental geography of the manufactured gas industry. I&amp;rsquo;ve also done work on the political ecology and human geography of Northern resource extraction, nuclear discourse and public understanding of sociotechnical controversies, and the politics of environmental knowledge production in remote environmental impact assessment.</description>

      <description>Tollefson, J. (2020) &amp;ldquo;Post-Fukushima discourse in the US press: Quantified knowledge, the technical object, and a panicked public&amp;rdquo; Public Understanding of Science | (PDF)
Many thought that the 11 March 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan might be the end of the “global nuclear renaissance.” In Europe, mass media after Fukushima increasingly presented negative framing of nuclear energy and highlighted declining support for the nuclear industry. In the United States, however, nuclear production and public support for the industry remained steady.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a description of the analysis process as it stands, as succinct as possible.
Sanborn maps Sanborn maps were published regularly starting in the late 19th century. Sanborn atlases cover most US cities with a population greater than about 6000 [@hathewayRemediationFormerManufactured2012], and most larger cities were mapped and remapped at regular intervals to account for changes to the urban landscape. Atlases consist of multiple map volumes made up of several hundred pages representing just a few square blocks of city space.</description>

For large extractive mineral projects, Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) processes function in part as a procedural tool to adjudicate the legitimacy of divergent environmental truth claims. Successful anti-extraction movements work to litigate divergent knowledge claims in the public arena, but few anti-extraction communities have access to a broad public audience.</description>

This article examines the social, historical and political constitution of land and resource imaginaries in Bristol Bay, Alaska. We compare the dynamics of these different imaginaries in the region within the early permitting debates concerning the proposed Pebble Mine to understand the contemporary politics of defining and constructing ideologies of extractive resource use.</description>

      <description>Frickel, S. and Tollefson, J. &amp;ldquo;Before Spindletop: New Computational Methods for Excavating America’s Forgotten Fossil Fuel Industry&amp;rdquo; Under review
From the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, many homes, institutions, and factories in the United States, Canada, Australia and much of Europe relied on gas produced from coal to light lamps and kitchen stoves. The manufactured gas industry sparked a revolution in urban form and function, while at the same time producing vast quantities of hazardous waste with minimal regulation.</description>
