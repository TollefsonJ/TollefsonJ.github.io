<h1 id="sanborn-maps">Sanborn maps</h1>
<p>Sanborn maps were published regularly starting in the late 19th century. Sanborn atlases cover most US cities with a population greater than about 6000 [@hathewayRemediationFormerManufactured2012], and most larger cities were mapped and remapped at regular intervals to account for changes to the urban landscape. Atlases consist of multiple map volumes made up of several hundred pages representing just a few square blocks of city space. Today, map files are available for public use primarily via three database providers (see @tbl:maps) with different approaches to digitization, file storage, and access.</p>
<p>| Source | Completeness | Access | Map quality | Download availability |
|&mdash;      |&mdash;-       |&mdash;    |&mdash;|
| ProQuest Sanborn Digital Ed. | Most complete  | Many university and public libraries | Low quality B+W line drawings | No bulk download |
| FIMo | Most complete | Some university and public libraries | High quality color scans | No bulk download |
| Library of Congress  | Very complete | Publicly available | High quality color scans | Simple bulk API |
Table: Sanborn map sources {#tbl:maps}</p>
<p>Library of Congress (LOC) maps are likely the best option for regional map analysis for two reasons. First, LOC maps are available for bulk download using a simple script to communicate with the LOC API. The API allows for map downloads at any regional and temporal scale; for example, a single API query returns all Sanborn files for every city in New England across every available publication year. Second, LOC files are stored as high quality digital color scans. Most circular features are color-filled and therefore more easily identifiable using the Hough.Circles package.</p>
<p>Two additional databases host digitized Sanborn images, most prominently ProQuest&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sanborn Digital Edition&rdquo; and Fire Insurance Maps Online (FIMo). Digital Edition maps are rendered as black and white line-drawings; they are widely available for multiple cities over multiple years, but suffer from low scan quality and frequent misprints. FIMo maps, like LOC map scans, are available in full color, but suffer from poor download resolution. The ProQuest and FIMo databases are marginally more complete than the LOC repository; neither database allows for bulk file downloads, however, severely limiting their utility for map analysis at a broad spatial and temporal scale. It is possible to partially automate the download process using CURL, taking advantage of the fact that the ProQuest and Sanborn databases store map pages according to a predictable sequence of URLs. FIMo maps are stored in a sequence of logically-numbered JPG files with a common base URL, which allows us to download FIMo maps city-by-city or volume-by-volume. The ProQuest database instead iterates components of the URL path for each maps page, and stores map files as PDF documents with a single filename (&ldquo;default.pdf&rdquo;). This requires that we first generate a list of unique URLs based on a set of predictable parameters, which is automated using a simple Python script. ProQuest maps can be downloaded volume-by-volume.</p>
<p>The CURL utility netted a total of 1367 individual map pages for the target Providence and Seattle atlases: 137 from the 1889 Providence map set; 441 from Providence, 1920; 164 from Seattle, 1893; and 625 from Seattle, 1916.</p>
<p>FIMo is structured in a manner especially amenable to CURL automation. Using simple CURL syntax, it is possible to download multiple volumes of multiple Sanborn atlases, across multiple years, by iterating different segments of the target URL. The Sanborn Digital database is slightly less accessible, however, and requires a separate CURL command for each Sanborn volume. Even so, CURL automation significantly reduces the time required to access map pages in bulk,and allows anybody with access to FIMo or Sanborn databases to easily download Sanborn maps for bulk analysis. Further time savings may be possible by purchasing sections of the FIMo or Sanborn databases directly.</p>
<h2 id="file-preparation">File preparation</h2>
<p>Each of the 1367 pages were directed through one of two Detect_Circles scripts, one optimized for color map scans (FIMo, Brown Digital Repository) and one for black and white Sanborn Digital files. Map pages from the FIMo and Brown Digital Repository sources were downloaded directly as JPG files. Sanborn Digital maps were downloaded as PDF documents and converted to JPG using PDF2IMG (<strong>source</strong>). Detect_Circles includes specific parameters for different circle radii, measured in number of pixels. Accordingly, all map images were resized to a common resolution. Map images were then blurred and converted to grayscale before being passed to the Detect_Circles algorithm.</p>
